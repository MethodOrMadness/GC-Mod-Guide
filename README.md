# GC Mod Guide

currently the language icon is disabled, this will be changed after a crowdin and all that shizz is setup
disabled on line 90 of `_includes/masthead.html`

most things inside curly braces in text bodies indicate links to pages that dont exist yet

## TODO
* Currently the PSOLoad guide is untested but it *should* be working. if someone can test and open an issue that would be amazing
* Save exploits have the base done, but a more in depth tutorial(mostly for picking a save, as well as uploading the save files named properly here need to be done)
* A lot of hardware guides are missing. This is pretty much method's territory so leave those alone
* SDMedia launcher / action replay guides are missing. I know nothing about them so i need someone to give a bit more info.
* Some pictures of a DOL-101 cube. inside and out. all angles. Please contact me(method) through the gamecube discord for more info

## File Structure
General info should just go in `_pages/en_US`, software guides should go in `_pages/en_US/software`, and hardware guides should go in `_pages/en_US/hardware`

User-downloadable files should be stored in `files`

### Save Exploits
Save exploit guides are stored under `_pages/en_US/software/saveExploits`. there is a file called `saveExploits.md`. this is the main page for save exploits and will have a TOC with all the other pages and other general info

### Hardware
