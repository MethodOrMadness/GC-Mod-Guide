## First, what is homebrew?
Homebrew is a general term that refers to code running on a device that wasn't designed to be user programable.

There is no single "homebrew" since it's a genre of software

Most of the time you use Swiss, an all-in-one homebrew utility for the Nintendo GameCube.

## How can I do it?

There are three (easy and modern) ways to boot into homebrew.
- The first being a drivechip such as the XenoGC to use burned discs on your gamecube
  * You will need some soldering experience to install it
- The second is using Save Game Exploits, but in order to use it you need a memory card with your exploit
  * either a gamecube/wii with homebrew to create it or you can buy an memory card with your exploit already installed.
- The third is an ODE, or an optical drive emulator.
  * currently, at the time of writing, the GCLoader (only ODE available) is out of stock. We advise against opting for the cloned "GCLoader Lite's" you see on ebay as these have lots of issues.

## Ways
### XenoGC
- This is probably what most people think of when it comes to homebrewing a gamecube. Solder a modchip onto your disc drive and read a burned game(it's a bit more involved than that but we will cover that on [this page](xenoInstall)).

### Game Save Exploits
- This is the second way, it is usually free (if you already have the game) or cheap and generally easy to setup
  * You can find more instructions on the [save game exploit](saveExploits) page!

### ODE(GCLoader)
- This is probably the easiest to do long term, short term requires a bit of knowledge on the cube. You essentially replace the disc drive with an SD card. This means you can autoboot a Swiss disc iso, but you can no longer use actual discs
