## First, what is homebrew?
Homebrew is a general term that refers to code running on a device that wasnt designed to be user programable.

There is no single "homebrew" since it's a genre of software

## Okay, that's pretty cool, but how do I do it?

There are three(easy and modern) ways to boot into homebrew. The first being a drivechip such as the XenoGC and a burned disc with swiss or your homebrew(needs to be packed a certain way, but this will be covered later.), and the third is a ODE, or an optical drive emulator.

## XenoGC

This is probably what most people think of when it comes to homebrewing a gamecube. Solder a modchip onto your disc drive and read a burned game(it's a bit more involved than that but we will cover that on [this page](xenoInstall)).

## Save game exploits

This is the second way, it is usually free or cheap(if you already have the game) and generally easy to setup. You can find more instructions on the [save game exploit](saveGameExploit) page!
