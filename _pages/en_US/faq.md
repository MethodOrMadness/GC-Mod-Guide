Q: What can I do with homebrew?

A: You can use homebrew to play game backups, dump save files to use with the Dolphin emulator, get ROM files from both GameCube and GBA titles, and more. 

Q: Do I need a boot disc?

A: If you don’t have any of the games listed, yes. However, they can be found for pretty cheap, so it’s easier to just buy the games.

Q: Can I use this to boot my Game Boy Player?

A: Yes! If you want the authentic experience, you can use an ISO file of the Game Boy Player’s boot disc. Otherwise, you can use Game Boy Interface, an improved version of the boot program. Both will run the same; the Game Boy Player itself contains all the hardware of a GBA, so it doesn’t run through emulation.

Q: Where can I find ISO files?

A: Can't help you, thats piracy and illegal.

Q: Is there anything I can’t play using Swiss?

A: There are some games that don’t work with Swiss, such as Alien Hominid and the NBA 2K games. There are also limitations on others, such as Tales of Symphonia and the Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell games. Check this link to see which games will work and which ones won’t.
