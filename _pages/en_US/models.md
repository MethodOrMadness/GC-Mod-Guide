title: "Different Models"

The gamecube has two distinct models(not including development units), these are the DOL-001 and DOL-101

## DOL-001
This is probably the "best" model to have. It has the digital output port, a removable gem, and most(early) units have a serail port 2(though the later ones still have the through holes making soldering easy if you wish to add an SD Card slot)
