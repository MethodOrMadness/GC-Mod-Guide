title: "Different Models"
---

The gamecube has two distinct models(not including development units), these are the DOL-001 and DOL-101

## DOL-001
This is probably the "best" model to have. It has the digital output port, a removable gem, and most(early) units have a serail port 2(though the later ones still have the through holes making soldering easy if you wish to add an SD Card slot)

## DOL-101
This is the later revision of the hardware, you can still homebrew it but you miss on some features of the hardware(notably an easy internal hdmi mod, SD2SP2). ODE's, savegame exploits, and SDGecko's still work all the same
