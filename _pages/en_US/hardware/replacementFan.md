## Disassembly
Follow the [disassembly](/disassembly) until you have removed the fan bracket

## Requirements
* GameBit screwdriver(see disassembly)
* Philips screwdriver(see disassembly)
* 3D printer(or you can buy the part from a printing service online)
* A soldering iron
* Replacement connector(since the fan you buy probably wont have the proper connector, this can also be harvested from the stock gamecube fan if you don't mind a bit of destruction)
## Variations
After removing the fan bracket you have two choices, the [40mm](/files/fan/40mmbracket.stl) bracket, which works with 40mm fans(including noctua), or the [50mm](/files/fan/50mmbracket.stl) bracket, which works with 50mm fans(currently, noctua doesn't offer one, but there are 50mm fan's available).

### 50mm

The 50mm fan bracket is larger, as it replaces the entire mounting part for the fan. As such it takes longer to 3D print.

### 40mm
[Download](/files/fan/40mmbracket.stl)

The 40mm bracket is smaller and fits inside the stock bracket, since it's just an adapter for the stock mounting bracket. This means less print time, but the fan does have to be smaller and can't move as much air.
