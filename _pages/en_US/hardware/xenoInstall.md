## About the xenoGC

The XenoGC Install is a lot easier than it first seems, though it does require a fair bit of soldering knowledge.

First, check out the [disassembly guide](/disassembly) before continuing! You need to have the RF Shield removed from the drive(looking at the PCB of the drive).

There are two types of installs, wired and wireless. Since the xenoGC is an open-source modchip(meaning anyone can make it), it's been cloned countless times, and the specifications of the pcb might be off. For this reason we personally recommend a wired install.
