Be noted that all these adapters have a semi noticable sag when plugged into an HDMI cable, you can print one of the various [support braces](/plugnplaysupport) to avoid this

### Carby
The [Insurrection Industries Carby](https://insurrectionindustries.com/product/carby-v2/) is probably one of the most recommended adapters, and at a good price for its features. It also includes an IR Remote to control the GCVideo OSD on its own. The carby is a base gcvideo device and is one of the easiest to update. So far i've heard no real complaints about the carby

### RetroBit Prism
The [Retrobit Prism](https://retro-bit.com/prism-hd/#hdadapter) is the more budget friendly option, and It also includes an IR Remote to control the GCVideo OSD on its own. The retrobit prism uses its own fork of gcVideo to allow for the "Easy update" function. If ease of updating is critical for you(for when gcvideo *is* updated), this is probably the best.

### Eon GCHD mk-II
The [EON GCHD MK-II](https://www.eongaming.tech/shop) is the most expensive adapter, but has some fitment issues and can sometimes feel like it takes too much force to insert. Sometimes the ports arent soldered correctly and you won't get analog audio. This device(along with the gcdual) uses a forked gcvideo by citrus3000psi due to them being more or less his hardware.
