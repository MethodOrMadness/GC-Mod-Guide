### RetroBit Prism
The [Retrobit Prism](https://retro-bit.com/prism-hd/#hdadapter) is the more budget friendly option, and It also includes an IR Remote to control the GCVideo OSD on its own

### Eon GCHD mk-II
The [EON GCHD MK-II](https://www.eongaming.tech/shop) is the most expensive adapter, but has some fitment issues and can sometimes feel like it takes too much force to insert.
