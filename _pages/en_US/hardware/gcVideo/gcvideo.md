## Info about GCVideo

[GCVideo](https://github.com/ikorb/gcvideo) is an [open-source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) FPGA firmware that can convert the GameCube(or Wii, but we won't get into that here) video to HDMI, written by ikorb. You could build your own, but thats a lot of work that won't be covered in this guide(for now), but instead you can pick a few of the ready-made adapters and install / use them.

## GCDual
Warning: This particular mod requires lots of internal modifications, and is not for the average user. it is incredibly difficult. If you don't have really good soldering skills, you should stick to one of the [Plug And Play Adapters](/gcvideo#plug-and-play-adapters)

## Plug And Play Adapters
All of these adapters plug directly into the digital out port in the gamecube, meaning they aren't compatible with the DOL-101 model without some more difficult hard mods
