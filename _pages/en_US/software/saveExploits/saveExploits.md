If you(or a friend) do not have a wii that you are willing to homebrew to do this, you can buy pre-made cards on ebay, but we don't have any recommended sellers, and if you do buy a pre-built card it's recommended to update the boot.gci on the card to the latest from swiss.

<!--NOTICE: For me, only the wii makes sense or a prebuild mem card-->
## About Save Exploits
- To use a Save Game Exploit, you will need:
  - A Wii with homebrew for creating a memory card
  - A Memory Card (at least 16MB!)
  - Your Game of choice

<!--NOTICE: Is it too much to ask?-->
You will need some knowledge about Wii Homebrew, as it would be too long to describe anything. You can learn more [here](https://wii.guide).
