## About Save Exploits
To use a Save Game Exploit, you will need:
  - A Wii with homebrew for creating a memory card
  - A Memory Card (at least 16MB!)
  - Your Game of choice

<!--NOTICE: Is it too much to ask?-->
You will need some knowledge about Wii Homebrew, as it would be too long to describe anything.
